## Image Segmentation 
This is a quite difficult problem. These days machine learning is being used to segment the images. In this app first of all we have initiate some points for segmentation via GUI. Then clustering algorithm is used. For this we need multiple features. Hence selection of features is important. List of features is included in the given report. Also, we have to maintain weighing of the features so that our segmentation is close to perfect. This is very expensive in terms is time and computations.
